Cronopio - A different cron-compatible cron-daemon
--------------------------------------------------

This is an initial commit.

Yes, I will use pycron to parse :P


The idea is for cronopio to enable for a more flexible notifications system,
include an API that could be queried by an app or website. Also, it needs
to support plugins and be useful in containers, etc.

Basically: all sysadmins hate getting cron output email, especially when nothing
useful is there, or is not well organized, etc.

Cronopio might support "some sort" of "centralization".
